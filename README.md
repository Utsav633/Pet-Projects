-- Overview of the Project--
Fetch Public Reddit API and display the posts from various sub-reddits.
Select the desired subreddit you want to see the posts from.
There are 2 options to view the posts
 --> Directly from the source of the posts e.g. vlogs, posts or parent sites.
 --> Opens the reddit site and leads where the post was related in reddit.

 Its a simple project nothing too fancy.
